Running a behaviour experiment
==============================

IBLRIG v8 provides users with two distinct interfaces: a command line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI).
The CLI encompasses the complete functionality of IBLRIG, upon which the GUI is constructed to enhance user-friendliness.
All tasks achievable through the GUI are equally achievable through the CLI.


The Graphical User Interface
----------------------------

To initiate a task through the graphical user interface, open a Windows PowerShell and enter:

.. code:: powershell

   C:\iblrigv8\venv\scripts\Activate.ps1
   iblrig

These commands activate the necessary environment and launch the IBLRIG Wizard GUI as shown below:

Starting a Task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Enter your Alyx username, then click on the *Connect* button. This
   action will automatically populate the GUI fields with information
   pertinent to your lab.

2. Select the desired values from the provided options. Utilize the
   *Filter* field to swiftly narrow down the list of displayed subjects.
   Note that selections for *Project* and *Procedure* are mandatory.

3. Click the *Start* button to initiate the task.


Supplementary Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  When starting a subsequent task with the same subject, you'll be asked if
   you want to append to the preceding session. Doing so will result in a
   sequence of connected tasks sharing the same data folder.

-  The *Flush* button serves to toggle the valve for cleaning purposes.

.. note::
   IBLRIG's Graphical User Interface is still work-in-progress. If you have any suggestions to make the GUI
   more usable, please add an `issue on GitHub <https://github.com/int-brain-lab/iblrig/issues>`_ or approach the dev-team on Slack!
   We are happy to discuss possible changes with you!


Interfacing with Alyx
---------------------

Although this is not mandatory, the IBLRIG GUI is designed to interface with `Alyx <https://github.com/cortex-lab/alyx>`_, the International Brain Laboratory's database.
This feature allows users to access their subjects and projects directly from the GUI, without the need to manually enter this information.

To enable this feature, you must have an Alyx account and have configured your database URL and credentials as mentioned  :doc:`installation`.

- The *subjects* available are the set of alyx subjects that are alive, not stock, and belong to the lab defined in the `iblrig_settings.py` file.
- The *projects* available are the set of projects of which the current user is a participant. Login to Alyx > Subjects > Projects to check your projects.


The Command Line Interface
--------------------------

To use the command line interface, open a terminal and activate the
environment:

.. code:: powershell

   cd C:\iblrigv8\
   venv\scripts\Activate.ps1

Running a single task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a single task, execute the following command:

.. code:: powershell

   python .\iblrig_tasks\_iblrig_tasks_trainingChoiceWorld\task.py --subject algernon --user john.doe

Chaining several tasks together
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To chain several tasks together, use the ``--append`` flag. For
instance, to run a passive task after an ephys task:

1. Run the ephys task

   .. code:: powershell

      .\iblrig_tasks\_iblrig_tasks_ephysChoiceWorld\task.py --subject algernon

2. Run the passive task with the ``--append``\ flag:

   .. code:: powershell

      .\iblrig_tasks\_iblrig_tasks_passiveChoiceWorld\task.py --subject algernon --append

Flushing the valve
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To flush valve 1 of the Bpod, type ``flush`` and confirm with ENTER. Press ENTER again to close the valve.
