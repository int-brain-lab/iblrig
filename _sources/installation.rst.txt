Installation guide
==================

.. prerequisites::

   *  A computer running Windows 10 or 11,
   *  A working installation of `git for windows <https://gitforwindows.org>`_, and
   *  `Notepad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org>`_ or some other decent text editor.

.. tip::

   iblrigv8 can be installed alongside older versions of iblrig without affecting the latter.

Preparing Windows PowerShell
----------------------------

Open Windows PowerShell in administrator mode:

* Click on the Windows Start button or press the Windows key on your keyboard.
* Type "PowerShell" into the search bar.
* You should see "Windows PowerShell" or "PowerShell" in the search results.
* Right-click on it.
* In the context menu that appears, select "Run as administrator."

Now, run the following command at the prompt of Windows PowerShell:

.. code-block:: powershell

   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force

.. tip::

   Keep the Administrator PowerShell open for the next step.

   In PowerShell, there are execution policies that determine the level of security for running scripts. The default execution
   policy is often set to ``Restricted``, which means that scripts are not allowed to run. However, to install Python or run
   certain scripts, you need to adjust the execution policy. By setting the execution policy to ``RemoteSigned``, you are
   allowing the execution of locally created scripts without any digital signature while requiring that remotely downloaded
   scripts (from the internet) must be digitally signed by a trusted source to run. This strikes a balance between security
   and usability.


Installing Visual C++ Redistributable
-------------------------------------

With the Administrator PowerShell still open, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: powershell

   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path C:\Temp
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/B/16B06F60-3B20-4FF2-B699-5E9B7962F9AE/VSU_4/vcredist_x64.exe  -OutFile C:\Temp\vcredist_x64.exe
   Start-Process -NoNewWindow -Wait -FilePath C:\Temp\vcredist_x64.exe -ArgumentList "/install", "/quiet", "/norestart"
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe  -OutFile C:\Temp\vc_redist.x64.exe
   Start-Process -NoNewWindow -Wait -FilePath C:\Temp\vc_redist.x64.exe -ArgumentList "/install", "/quiet", "/norestart"

.. warning:: Make sure you exit the Administrator PowerShell before continuing with the next steps!

.. admonition:: Background

   These commands will create a temporary directory, download and install the Visual C++ Redistributable package for
   64-bit Windows systems. The installer is retrieved from a Microsoft server and executed with parameters to ensure a seamless
   and unobtrusive installation process.


Installing Python 3.10
----------------------

Open a `new` Windows Powershell prompt (no administrator mode) and run the following:

.. code-block:: powershell

   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path C:\Temp
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-amd64.exe -OutFile C:\Temp\python-3.10.11-amd64.exe
   Start-Process -NoNewWindow -Wait -FilePath C:\Temp\python-3.10.11-amd64.exe -ArgumentList "/passive", "InstallAllUsers=0", "Include_launcher=0", "Include_test=0"

Check that everything worked by running the following command:

.. code-block:: powershell

   &$env:UserProfile\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe --version

The command should return ``Python 3.10.11``


.. admonition:: Background
   :class: seealso

   These commands will create a temporary directory, download the Python installer from a specific URL, and then execute the
   installer with specific installation options, all in a controlled and automated manner.


Installing iblrigv8
-------------------

1. From the Powershell command line, clone the `iblrigv8` branch of iblrig to ``C:\iblrigv8``:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      git clone -b iblrigv8 https://github.com/int-brain-lab/iblrig.git C:\iblrigv8


2. Install a new virtual environment and update pip:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      &$env:UserProfile\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe -m venv C:\iblrigv8\venv
      C:\iblrigv8\venv\scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel


3. Install iblrig in editable mode:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\iblrigv8\venv\scripts\Activate.ps1
      cd C:\iblrigv8
      pip install -e .


4. Install Spinnaker SDK and PySpin:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      install_spinnaker
      install_pyspin


5. Install Bonsai in portable mode:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      cd C:\iblrigv8\Bonsai
      powershell.exe .\install.ps1
      cd ..


6. Install additional tasks and extractors for personal projects (optional):

   .. code-block:: powershell

      git clone https://github.com/int-brain-lab/project_extraction.git C:\project_extraction
      cd C:\project_extraction
      pip install -e .


7. Continue with :ref:`the next section<Configuration instructions>`.


Configuration Instructions
--------------------------

Rig Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy the template settings files:

.. code-block::

   cd C:\iblrigv8\settings
   cp hardware_settings_template.yaml hardware_settings.yaml
   cp iblrig_settings_template.yaml iblrig_settings.yaml
   explorer C:\iblrigv8\settings


Update the two settings files using a text-editor:

*  ``iblrig_settings.yaml``
*  ``hardware_settings.yaml``

If the computer has been used with IBLRIG version 7 or earlier, the correct values can likely be found in ``C:\iblrig_params\
.iblrig_params.json``.


Setting up ONE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Setup ONE to connect to https://alyx.internationalbrainlab.org, you will need your Alyx username and password.

See instructions for that here: https://int-brain-lab.github.io/iblenv/notebooks_external/one_quickstart.html


.. exercise:: Make sure you can connect to Alyx !

   Open a Python shell in the environment and connect to Alyx (you may have to setup ONE)

   .. code-block::

      C:\iblrigv8\venv\scripts\Activate.ps1
      ipython

   Then at the IPython prompt

   .. code-block:: python

      from one.api import ONE
      one = ONE(username='your_username', password='your_password', base_url='https://alyx.internationalbrainlab.org')


.. exercise:: You can check that everything went fine by running the test suite:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      cd C:\iblrigv8
      python -m unittest discover

   The tests should pass to completion after around 40 seconds


Updating iblrigv8
-----------------

To update iblrigv8 to the newest version:

.. code-block:: powershell

  C:\iblrigv8\venv\scripts\Activate.ps1
  cd C:\iblrigv8
  git pull
  pip install --upgrade -e .


To update the additional tasks and extractors (see :ref:`Installing iblrigv8`, point 5):

.. code-block:: powershell

  cd C:\project_extraction
  git pull


.. tip::

   While usually quite snappy, upgrading the virtual environment in some instances can take longer than expected.
   Please be patient during the upgrade procedure.


Switch to specific iblrig version
---------------------------------
.. warning:: Downgrading is not recommended and may not work as some releases break compatibility with earlier versions.

First fetch all available version tags and list them:

.. code-block:: powershell

  C:\iblrigv8\venv\scripts\Activate.ps1
  cd C:\iblrigv8
  git fetch --all --tags --prune
  git tag --list '8.*'

Then switch to the desired version, for example `8.15.5`:

.. code-block:: powershell

  git checkout tags/8.15.5
  pip install --upgrade -e .
