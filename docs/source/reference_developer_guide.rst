Developer Guide
===============


Versioning Scheme
-----------------

IBLRIG v8 uses `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`_.
Its version string (currently "|version|") is a combination of three fields, separated by dots:

.. centered:: ``MAJOR`` . ``MINOR`` . ``PATCH``

* The ``MAJOR`` field is only incremented for breaking changes, i.e., changes that are not backward compatible with previous changes.
  Releases of IBLRIG v8, for instance, are generally incompatible with IBLRIG v7.
* The ``MINOR`` field will be incremented upon adding new, backwards compatible features.
* The ``PATCH`` field will be incremented with each new, backwards compatible bugfix release that does not implement a new feature.

On the developer side, these 3 fields are manually controlled by, both

   1. adjusting the variable ``__version__`` in ``iblrig/__init__.py``, and
   2. adding the corresponding version string to a commit as a `git tag <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging>`_,
      for instance:

      .. code-block:: console

         git tag 8.8.4
         git push origin --tags

The version string displayed by IBLRIG *may* include additional fields, such as in "|version|.post3+dirty".
Here,

* ``post3`` indicates the third unversioned commit after the latest versioned release, and
* ``dirty`` indicates the presence of uncommited changes in your local repository of IBLRIG.

Both of these fields are inferred by means of git describe and do not require manual interaction from the developer.


PDM
---

We use `PDM <https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/>`_ to manage dependencies of IBLRIG.
See `PDM's documentation <https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/#installation>` for help with installing PDM.


Installing Developer Dependencies
---------------------------------

To install additional dependencies needed for working on IBLRIG's code-base, run:

.. code-block:: console

   pdm sync -d


Running Unit Tests Locally
--------------------------

To run unit tests locally, run:

.. code-block:: console

   pdm run pytest

This will also generate a coverage report which can be found in the ``htmlcov`` directory.


Linting & Formatting
--------------------

To lint your code, run the:

.. code-block:: console

   pdm run ruff check

Adding the commandline flag ``--fix`` will automatically fix issues that are deemed safe to handle:

.. code-block:: console

   pdm run ruff check --fix

To *check* if your code conforms to the `Black code style <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html>`_, run:

.. code-block:: console

   pdm run ruff format --check

To reformat your code according to the `Black code style <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html>`_, run:

.. code-block:: console

   pdm run ruff format

Refer to `Ruff Formater's documentation <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/>`_ for further details.


pre-commit
----------

IBLRIG v8 supports pre-commit hooks.
Install pre-commit according to the `official guide <https://pre-commit.com/#install>`_ to enable automated code-checks on commits.


Release Checklist
-----------------

1) update CHANGELOG.md including changes from the last tag
2) Pull request to ``iblrigv8dev``
3) Check CI and eventually wet lab test
4) Pull request to ``iblrigv8``
5) Merge PR
6) git tag the release in accordance to the version number below (after merge!)


Building the documentation
--------------------------

.. code-block:: console

   pdm run sphinx-autobuild ./docs/source ./docs/build


Contribute to the documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To write the documentation:

* Write the documentation in the ``iblrig/docs/source`` folder
* If you are writing in a new file, add it to the ``index.rst`` so it appears in the table of content
* Push all your changes to the ``iblrigv8dev`` branch ; if this branch does not exist, create it first

To release the documentation onto the `website <https://int-brain-lab.github.io/iblrig>`_:

* Wait for the next release, or
* Manually trigger the GitHub action by clicking "Run Workflow" (select ``master``) `here <https://github.com/int-brain-lab/iblrig/actions/workflows/docs.yaml>`_
