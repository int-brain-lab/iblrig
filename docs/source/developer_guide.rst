Versioning Scheme
=================

IBLRIG v8 uses `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`_.
Its version string (currently "|version|") is a combination of three fields, separated by dots:

.. centered:: ``MAJOR`` . ``MINOR`` . ``PATCH``

* The ``MAJOR`` field is only incremented for breaking changes, i.e., changes that are not backward compatible with previous changes.
  Releases of IBLRIG v8, for instance, are generally incompatible with IBLRIG v7.
* The ``MINOR`` field will be incremented upon adding new, backwards compatible features.
* The ``PATCH`` field will be incremented with each new, backwards compatible bugfix release that does not implement a new feature.

On the developer side, these 3 fields are manually controlled by adding the respective version string to a commit as a `git tag <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging>`_, for instance:

.. code-block:: console

   git tag 8.8.4
   git push origin --tags

The version string displayed by IBLRIG *may* include additional fields, such as in "|version|.post3+dirty".
Here,

* ``.post3`` indicates the third unversioned commit after the latest versioned release, and
* ``+dirty`` indicates the presence of uncommited changes in your local repository of IBLRIG.

Both of these fields are inferred by `setuptools_scm <https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/>`_ and do not require manual interaction from the developer.


Running Tests Locally
=====================

.. code-block:: console

   flake8
   python -m unittest discover ./iblrig/test


Building the documentation
==========================

.. code-block:: console

   # make sure pre-requisites are installed
   pip install --upgrade -e .[DEV]
   # create the static directory
   rm -rf ./docs/build
   mkdir -p ./docs/build/html/_static
   # unit tests generate task diagrams
   python -m unittest discover ./iblrig/test
   # generate class diagrams
   pyreverse -o png -m y --ignore iblrig.test -A --output-directory ./docs/build/html/_static ./iblrig_tasks
   # build and serve the docs locally
   sphinx-autobuild ./docs/source ./docs/build/html/



Guide to Creating Your Own Task
===============================

What Happens When Running an IBL Task?
--------------------------------------

1. The task constructor is invoked, executing the following steps:

   -  Reading of settings: hardware and IBLRIG configurations.
   -  Reading of task parameters.
   -  Instantiation of hardware mixins.

2. The task initiates the ``run()`` method. Prior to execution, this
   method:

   -  Launches the hardware modules.
   -  Establishes a session folder.
   -  Saves the parameters to disk.

3. The experiment unfolds: the ``run()`` method triggers the ``_run()``
   method within the child class:

   -  Typically, this involves a loop that generates a Bpod state
      machine for each trial and runs it.

4. Upon SIGINT or when the maximum trial count is reached, the
   experiment concludes. The end of the ``run()`` method includes:

   -  Saving the final parameter file.
   -  Recording administered water and session performance on Alyx.
   -  Halting the mixins.
   -  Initiating local server transfer.

Writing Your Own Task
---------------------

iblrig.base_tasks.BaseTask
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This serves as the fundamental class for all tasks. It supplies abstract
methods and functions to establish the folder structure and perform Alyx
database registration.

1. When creating a subclass of BaseTask, you must override the following
   methods:

   -  ``_run()``: Main method of the task, wrapped by the ``run()``
      method that incorporates folder creation and Alyx interaction pre-
      and post-task.
   -  ``start_hardware()``: Method to activate hardware modules and
      establish connections.

2. Document your protocol name using the ``protocol_name`` property.

Hardware Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within ``iblrig.base_tasks``, hardware mixins are dedicated to specific
modules. These mixin classes deliver hardware-specific functionality. To
use those mixins, compose them with the ``BaseClass`` above.

Mixins for hardware modules decouple hardware-specific code from task
code: - The ``init_mixin_*()`` methods are called at instantiation, so
they need to work regardless of whether the hardware is connected or
not. - The ``start_mixin_*()`` methods are called at the beginning of
the ``run()`` method, ensuring that the hardware is properly connected.
- The ``stop_mixin_*()`` methods are called at the end of the ``run()``
method, ensuring that the hardware is properly disconnected.

To test only the hardware, you can instantiate the task and call the
``start_hardware()`` and ``stop_hardware()`` methods.

iblrig.base_choice_world.ChoiceWorld
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a subclass of ``BaseTask`` that implements the IBL
decision-making task family. When subclassing ``ChoiceWorld``, you must
override the following methods: - ``next_trial()``
