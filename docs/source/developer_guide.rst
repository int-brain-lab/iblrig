Release Checklist
=================

1) update CHANGELOG.md including changes from the last tag
2) Pull request to ``iblrigv8dev``
3) Check CI and eventually wet lab test
4) Pull request to ``iblrigv8``
5) Merge PR
6) git tag the release in accordance to the version number below (after merge!)

Versioning Scheme
=================

IBLRIG v8 uses `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`_.
Its version string (currently "|version|") is a combination of three fields, separated by dots:

.. centered:: ``MAJOR`` . ``MINOR`` . ``PATCH``

* The ``MAJOR`` field is only incremented for breaking changes, i.e., changes that are not backward compatible with previous changes.
  Releases of IBLRIG v8, for instance, are generally incompatible with IBLRIG v7.
* The ``MINOR`` field will be incremented upon adding new, backwards compatible features.
* The ``PATCH`` field will be incremented with each new, backwards compatible bugfix release that does not implement a new feature.

On the developer side, these 3 fields are manually controlled by, both

   1. adjusting the variable ``__version__`` in ``iblrig/__init__.py``, and
   2. adding the corresponding version string to a commit as a `git tag <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging>`_,
      for instance:

      .. code-block:: console

         git tag 8.8.4
         git push origin --tags

The version string displayed by IBLRIG *may* include additional fields, such as in "|version|.post3+dirty".
Here,

* ``post3`` indicates the third unversioned commit after the latest versioned release, and
* ``dirty`` indicates the presence of uncommited changes in your local repository of IBLRIG.

Both of these fields are inferred by means of git describe and do not require manual interaction from the developer.


Running Tests Locally
=====================

.. code-block:: console

   flake8
   python -m unittest discover ./iblrig/test


Building the documentation
==========================

.. code-block:: console

   # make sure pre-requisites are installed
   pip install --upgrade -e .[DEV]
   # create the static directory
   rm -rf ./docs/build
   mkdir -p ./docs/build/html/_static
   # unit tests generate task diagrams
   python -m unittest discover ./iblrig/test
   # generate class diagrams
   pyreverse -o png -m y --ignore iblrig.test -A --output-directory ./docs/build/html/_static ./iblrig_tasks
   # build and serve the docs locally
   sphinx-autobuild ./docs/source ./docs/build/html/

Contribute to the documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To write the documentation:

* Write the documentation in the ``iblrig/docs/source`` folder
* If you are writing in a new file, add it to the ``index.rst`` so it appears in the table of content
* Push all your changes to the ``iblrigv8dev`` branch ; if this branch does not exist, create it first

To release the documentation onto the `website <https://int-brain-lab.github.io/iblrig>`__:

* Wait for the next release, or
* Manually trigger the GitHub action by clicking "Run Workflow" (select ``master``) here: https://github.com/int-brain-lab/iblrig/actions/workflows/docs.yaml

Guide to Creating Your Own Task
===============================

What Happens When Running an IBL Task?
--------------------------------------

1. The task constructor is invoked, executing the following steps:

   -  Reading of settings: hardware and IBLRIG configurations.
   -  Reading of task parameters.
   -  Instantiation of hardware mixins.

2. The task initiates the ``run()`` method. Prior to execution, this
   method:

   -  Launches the hardware modules.
   -  Establishes a session folder.
   -  Saves the parameters to disk.

3. The experiment unfolds: the ``run()`` method triggers the ``_run()``
   method within the child class:

   -  Typically, this involves a loop that generates a Bpod state
      machine for each trial and runs it.

4. Upon SIGINT or when the maximum trial count is reached, the
   experiment concludes. The end of the ``run()`` method includes:

   -  Saving the final parameter file.
   -  Recording administered water and session performance on Alyx.
   -  Halting the mixins.
   -  Initiating local server transfer.
